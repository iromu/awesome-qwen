## Description: <br>
Author agentic Java/Kotlin services on the JVM with the Embabel v1.5.1 Spring-based framework, which mixes LLM calls with non-LLM planning (GOAP, Utility AI, Hybrid, Supervisor) across agent authoring, tools, provider configuration, MCP publishing, testing and migration from CrewAI/Pydantic AI/LangGraph. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Third-Party Community Consideration
<span style="color:#d73a49">This skill is not owned or developed by NVIDIA. This skill has been developed and built to a third-party's requirements for this application and use case; see link to Non-NVIDIA [Iván Rodríguez Murillo Agent Card](https://github.com/iromu/awesome-qwen).</span> <!-- VERIFY: The author e-mail in the frontmatter is a personal, non-NVIDIA address and the repository is a third-party awesome list; the card_link is the source repo because no separate vendor card exists. --> <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
<span style="color:#d73a49">MIT</span> <!-- VERIFY: No LICENSE or NOTICE file exists anywhere in the repository; MIT comes only from a 'License: MIT' badge in the root README, so the actual terms must be confirmed before submission. --> <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers building agentic backend services on the JVM with Embabel: choosing a planner and execution mode, writing @Agent/@Action/@Tool code and domain models, selecting per-action model providers and roles, publishing an agent as an MCP server, and testing or migrating an existing Python agent framework (CrewAI, Pydantic AI, LangGraph) onto it. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Yes] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [API key] <br>  

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. See skill body for more details. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [Code, Configuration instructions, Analysis] <br>

**Output Parameters:** [1D] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [None] <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Validated against 14 internal eval cases in `evals/evals.json` (all positive-trigger, each with an expected-output description and per-case assertions on real Embabel symbols such as @Agent/@Action classes, FakeOperationContext tests and provider configuration), plus 9 automated validator checks (schema/repository governance, semantic version, license, code risk, secrets, dead links/dependencies, Unicode, quality and script lint). <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Correctness: Whether the Embabel API the answer asserts is real for v1.5.1 — correct starter artifacts, annotation attributes, planner and @State semantics — rather than asserted from memory. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the skill fires on Embabel agent-authoring requests (agents, tools, planners, MCP publishing, migration) and stays silent on the non-Embabel work its 'When NOT to Use' table routes elsewhere. <br>
- Reliability: Whether the skill reaches the expected result consistently across repeat runs, including that it consults references/ rather than inventing symbols. <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill resolves the task through the right section and reference file without unnecessary steps or context overhead. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `expected_output`: Per-case description of the class, test or configuration the answer should produce. <br>
- `assertions`: Per-case checks on the specific annotations, API calls and configuration keys the answer must contain. <br>
- `should_trigger`: Routing check that the skill activates for the request; every case in this file is a positive-trigger case. <br>
