## Problem

After optimizing prompts and task design, agents may still underperform on specific business tasks because:
- **Domain shift**: Tools and business context differ from what the base model was trained on
- **Inefficient tool use**: Agents make too many tool calls or use wrong tools
- **Suboptimal reasoning**: The model doesn't reason well across specific tool outputs

## Solution

**Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Agent RFT)** trains model weights end-to-end on agentic tasks:

1. **Explore via actual tool calls** — During training rollouts, the agent calls real tool endpoints
2. **Receive custom reward signals** — Define what "good" looks like via flexible graders
3. **Learn multi-step reasoning** — The agent learns to reason across tool outputs
4. **Optimize for your metrics** — Reduce tool calls, improve accuracy, or balance both

**Grader Design Best Practices:**
- Use gradient rewards (0-1 floats, not binary 0/1) for clearer learning signals
- Prevent reward hacking: evaluate reasoning process, not just final answers
- Align with domain knowledge: measure grader-human consistency before training

## Evidence

- **Evidence Grade:** `validated-in-production`
- **Production Implementations:** OpenAI Agent RFT, Ambience Healthcare (ICD-10 coding: F1 0.52→0.57), Cognition (50% reduction in planning tool calls)

## How to use it

1. **Baseline evaluation:** Run base model multiple times per sample to measure variance
2. **Host tools:** Deploy tool endpoints (FastAPI, Modal, etc.) that mirror production
3. **Design grader:** Create reward function that's hard to game, provides gradient
4. **Monitor training:** Watch reward curves, tool call distributions, reasoning token counts
5. **Evaluate results:** Compare fine-tuned model on validation set

## Trade-offs

**Pros:** End-to-end optimization, sample efficient (100-1000 samples), flexible rewards, natural speedups, domain adaptation.
**Cons:** Infrastructure complexity, bursty traffic during training, grader design effort, debugging difficulty.
