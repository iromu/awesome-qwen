## Problem

While layered configuration files provide good baseline context, agents often need specific pieces of information (e.g., contents of a particular file, output of a script, predefined complex prompt) on-demand during an interactive session. Constantly editing static context files or pasting large chunks of text into prompts is inefficient.

## Solution

Implement mechanisms for users to dynamically inject context into the agent's working memory during a session. Common approaches include:

- **File/Folder At-Mentions:** Allowing users to type a special character (e.g., `@`) followed by a file or folder path (e.g., `@src/components/Button.tsx` or `@app/tests/`). The agent then ingests the content of the specified file or a summary of the folder into its current context for the ongoing task.
- **Custom Slash Commands:** Enabling users to define reusable, named prompts or instructions in separate files (e.g., in `~/.claude/commands/foo.md`). These can be invoked with a slash command (e.g., `/user:deployment`), causing their content to be loaded into the agent's context.

## Evidence

- **Evidence Grade:** `established`
- **Universal Adoption:** Implemented across all major AI coding platforms as the de facto standard
- **Security-Critical:** Path traversal and credential exfiltration are primary concerns requiring allowlist validation and secret scanning

## How to use it

- Use this when model quality depends on selecting or retaining the right context.
- Start with strict context budgets and explicit memory retention rules.
- Measure relevance and retrieval hit-rate before increasing memory breadth.
- Implement security controls: allowlist-based directory access, regex-based credential scanning, file size limits

## Trade-offs

* **Pros:** Raises answer quality by keeping context relevant and reducing retrieval noise.
* **Cons:** Requires ongoing tuning of memory policies and indexing quality.
