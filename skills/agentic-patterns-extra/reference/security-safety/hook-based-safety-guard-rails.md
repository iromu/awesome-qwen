  Use hooks to enforce safety constraints on autonomous agent behavior — intercept
  tool calls, validate actions, and block dangerous operations before execution.

## Problem

Autonomous code agents executing without constraints can perform dangerous operations — deleting production data, modifying security configurations, or executing arbitrary commands. Unchecked autonomy creates significant risk.

## Solution

Implement hook-based guard rails that intercept agent actions before execution, allowing validation and blocking of dangerous operations.

**Hook types:**

1. **Pre-execution hooks** — run before a tool is called, can block or modify the call
2. **Post-execution hooks** — run after execution, can trigger alerts or rollback
3. **Context hooks** — modify the agent's context or available tools dynamically

**Common safety constraints:**

- Block destructive file operations (rm -rf, truncate)
- Require approval for database writes/deletes
- Limit shell command scope (no network commands, no privilege escalation)
- Validate file paths against allowed directories
- Rate-limit tool calls to prevent abuse

```pseudo
# Pre-execution hook example
def on_tool_call(tool_name, args):
    if tool_name == "shell" and "rm -rf" in args:
        return Block("Destructive shell command blocked")
    if tool_name == "database" and args.get("operation") == "delete":
        return RequireApproval("Database delete requires human approval")
    return Allow
```

## How to use it

**When to apply:**

- Autonomous agents with file system or database access
- Production environments where agent mistakes have real consequences
- Teams new to agent autonomy that need safety nets

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**

- Prevents catastrophic agent mistakes
- Enables safe experimentation with autonomous agents
- Audit trail of blocked and allowed actions

**Cons:**

- Can slow down agent execution
- Overly restrictive hooks may frustrate agents
- Requires ongoing maintenance as agent capabilities grow
