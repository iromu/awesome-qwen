## Problem

Agents may avoid using tools even when they would improve outcomes, or use them inefficiently. Without proper reward shaping, agents optimize for token efficiency rather than task success.

## Solution

Shape rewards to incentivize effective tool use:
- Positive reward for correct tool selection and usage
- Negative reward for tool misuse or avoidance
- Gradient rewards for progressive tool mastery

## Evidence

- **Evidence Grade:** `proposed`
- **Academic Foundation:** RLHF research on reward shaping

## How to use it

- Design reward functions that value tool use appropriately
- Provide gradient signals for tool mastery
- Balance between exploration and exploitation of tools

## Trade-offs

**Pros:** Encourages effective tool use, progressive mastery, better task outcomes.
**Cons:** Requires careful reward design, may incentivize tool overuse.
