## Problem

Simple reward functions that only check for "all tests passed" fail to capture nuanced code quality issues (e.g., performance regressions, style violations, missing edge-case handling). A single binary signal at the end cannot guide the agent to produce maintainable, high-quality code.

## Solution

Use an **inference-healed reward model**—a code-review critic that:

**1. Decomposes Code Quality into Subcriteria**
- **Correctness:** Does the code pass all tests?
- **Style:** Are linters satisfied?
- **Performance:** Are there clear performance regressions?
- **Security:** Does a static analyzer flag critical issues?

**2. Runs Internal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
- If uncertain about a subcriterion, the critic runs a short CoT inside itself
- This "inference healing" allows the reward model to **explain** each sub-score

**3. Aggregates Subscores**
- Each subcriterion returns a float ∈ [0, 1]
- A weighted sum yields the final code-review score

**4. Generates Human-Readable Feedback**
- Alongside a numerical score, return a short analysis explaining issues

## Evidence

- **Evidence Grade:** `proposed`
- **Industry Validation:** Multi-criteria code review deployed at scale by Microsoft (600K+ PRs/month), Tencent (325M lines/month), Tekion (60% faster time to merge)

## How to use it

- **Critic Dataset Collection:** Gather examples of good vs. bad code patches
- **Critic Training:** Fine-tune a small LLM (1–2 B parameters) to produce sub-scores and CoT justifications
- **Integration into RL Loop:** Replace or augment the existing binary "tests-passed" reward
- **Selective Healing:** Generate CoT explanations only for subscores below a threshold

## Trade-offs

- **Pros:** Explainable feedback, higher code quality (performance, security included).
- **Cons:** Compute overhead per reward invocation, critic maintenance as standards evolve.
