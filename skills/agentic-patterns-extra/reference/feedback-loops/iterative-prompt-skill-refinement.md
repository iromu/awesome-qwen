## Problem

Agent usage reveals gaps in prompts, skills, and tools—but how do you systematically improve them? When a workflow fails or behaves sub-optimally, you need multiple mechanisms to capture feedback and iterate.

## Solution

Implement **multiple complementary refinement mechanisms** that work together:

1. **Responsive Feedback (Primary)** — Monitor internal `#ai` channel for issues, skim workflow interactions daily
2. **Owner-Led Refinement (Secondary)** — Store prompts in editable documents (Notion, Google Docs), include prompt links in workflow outputs
3. **Claude-Enhanced Refinement (Specialized)** — Use observability MCP to pull logs into skill repository
4. **Dashboard Tracking (Quantitative)** — Track workflow run frequency, errors, and tool usage

## Evidence

- **Evidence Grade:** `established`
- **Key Findings:**
  - Grounded in RLHF research (human feedback is irreplaceable for alignment)
  - RLAIF demonstrates AI-assisted feedback enables scale
  - Multi-layered approach catches issues different mechanisms miss

## How to use it

**Implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Feedback channel: Internal Slack/Discord for agent issues
- [ ] Editable prompts: Store in Notion/docs, not code
- [ ] Prompt links: Include in every workflow output
- [ ] Log access: Datadog/observability with MCP integration
- [ ] Dashboards: Track workflow runs, errors, tool usage

**Refinement workflow:**
- **Daily:** Skim feedback channel, review workflow interactions
- **Weekly:** Review dashboard metrics for error spikes
- **Ad-hoc:** Pull logs when specific issues reported
- **Quarterly:** Comprehensive prompt/skill audit

## Trade-offs

**Pros:** Multi-layered (catches issues different mechanisms miss), continuous improvement, accessible (anyone can contribute), data-driven prioritization.
**Cons:** No silver bullet, maintenance overhead for multiple systems, permission complexity, alert fatigue risk.
