description: >-
  Curated catalogue of 140+ agentic AI patterns — real-world tricks, workflows,
  and mini-architectures that help autonomous or semi-autonomous AI agents get
  useful work done in production. Use this skill whenever the user asks about
  agent architecture, agent design patterns, how to solve an agent-related
  challenge, or wants recommendations for patterns. Trigger on questions about
  context management, multi-agent coordination, reliability, security, tool use,
  feedback loops, learning & adaptation, or human-agent collaboration. Also
  trigger when the user wants to compare patterns, find the right pattern for a
  use case, understand trade-offs between different agent approaches, or wants
  to know which patterns work best together. Don't hesitate to suggest patterns
  even when the user doesn't explicitly mention "patterns" — if they describe an
  agent problem, this skill likely applies.

# Agentic Patterns Extra

A curated catalogue of agentic AI patterns sourced from [nibzard/awesome-agentic-patterns](https://github.com/nibzard/awesome-agentic-patterns), backed by public references (blog posts, talks, repos, papers).

> **Why?** Tutorials show toy demos. Real products hide the messy bits. This catalogue surfaces the repeatable patterns that bridge the gap so you can ship smarter, faster agents.

## What counts as a pattern

- **Repeatable** — more than one team is using it.
- **Agent-centric** — improves how an AI agent senses, reasons, or acts.
- **Traceable** — backed by a public reference.

## How to use this skill

When the user asks about agentic patterns, agent architecture, or how to solve a specific agent-related challenge:

1. **Identify the problem domain** — context management, reliability, security, orchestration, tool use, feedback, learning, or human collaboration.
2. **Match to relevant patterns** — read the pattern files in `reference/` for detailed guidance.
3. **Consider trade-offs** — every pattern has pros and cons; present them honestly.
4. **Suggest combinations** — patterns often work best when combined (e.g., Structured Output + Reflection Loop).
5. **Check evidence level** — note which patterns are `validated-in-production` vs `emerging` vs `experimental`.
