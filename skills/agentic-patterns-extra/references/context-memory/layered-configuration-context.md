## Problem

AI agents require relevant context to perform effectively. Providing this context manually in every prompt is cumbersome, and a one-size-fits-all global context is often too broad or too narrow. Different projects, users, and organizational policies may require different baseline information for the agent.

## Solution

Implement a system of layered configuration files (e.g., named `CLAUDE.md` or similar) that the agent automatically discovers and loads based on their location in the file system hierarchy. This allows for:

- **Enterprise/Organizational Context:** A root-level file (`/<enterprise_root>/CLAUDE.md`) for policies shared across all projects.
- **User-Specific Global Context:** A file in the user's home directory (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) for personal preferences.
- **Project-Specific Context:** A file within the project's root directory (`<project_root>/CLAUDE.md`), typically version-controlled.
- **Project-Local Context:** A local, non-version-controlled file (`<project_root>/CLAUDE.local.md`) for individual overrides.

The agent intelligently merges or prioritizes these context layers, providing a rich, tailored baseline without manual intervention.

## Evidence

- **Evidence Grade:** `validated-in-production`
- **Universal Adoption:** Implemented across all major AI coding platforms (Claude Code, Cursor, Continue.dev)

## How to use it

- Use this when model quality depends on selecting or retaining the right context.
- Start with strict context budgets and explicit memory retention rules.
- Measure relevance and retrieval hit-rate before increasing memory breadth.
- Version-control project context (`CLAUDE.md`); exclude local overrides (`CLAUDE.local.md`) from VCS.

## Trade-offs

* **Pros:** Raises answer quality by keeping context relevant and reducing retrieval noise; enables enterprise-wide policy enforcement; supports automatic context loading without manual intervention.
* **Cons:** Requires ongoing tuning of memory policies and indexing quality; context window limits may truncate layers; potential for configuration conflicts.
