## Problem

As the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has grown, MCP servers may expose 50+ tools that consume significant context space. Documented setups with 7+ servers have been documented consuming 67k+ tokens just for tool descriptions.

## Solution

Implement Tool Search: a lazy-loading mechanism where tools are dynamically loaded into context via search only when needed, rather than preloaded on initialization.

**Core mechanics:**
1. **Threshold detection**: Monitor when tool descriptions would exceed a context threshold (e.g., 10% of context window)
2. **Search interface**: Provide a ToolSearchTool that allows agents to search tool metadata and selectively load tools
3. **Server instructions**: Leverage MCP server instruction fields to guide the agent on when to search for specific tools
4. **Agentic search**: Use intelligent search rather than basic RAG to find relevant tools

## Evidence

- **Evidence Grade:** `emerging`
- **Key Findings:**
  - Dramatically reduces baseline context usage (67k+ tokens to just metadata)
  - Enables scaling to 100+ tools without context issues
  - Faster cold-start times when tools aren't needed

## How to use it

**For MCP server creators:**
- Enhance server instructions to help agents know when to search for your tools
- Include rich descriptions and tags to improve searchability
- Organize related tools to make discovery more intuitive

**For MCP client creators:**
- Implement ToolSearchTool for search-based discovery
- Use agentic search (not basic vector RAG)
- Set appropriate thresholds based on your use case (Claude Code uses 10%)
- Provide opt-out for users who prefer preloading

## Trade-offs

* **Pros:** Dramatically reduces baseline context usage, enables scaling to 100+ tools, faster cold-start times, better tool discovery.
* **Cons:** Adds latency when tools need to be dynamically loaded, requires search infrastructure, may miss serendipitous discovery, additional complexity.
