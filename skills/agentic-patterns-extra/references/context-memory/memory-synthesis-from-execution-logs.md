## Problem

Individual task execution transcripts contain valuable learnings, but:
- **Too specific**: "Make this button pink" isn't useful as general guidance
- **Unknown relevance**: Hard to predict which learnings apply to future tasks
- **Scattered knowledge**: Insights buried across hundreds of conversation logs
- **Abstraction challenge**: Difficult to know the right level of generality

## Solution

Implement a **two-tier memory system**:

1. **Task diaries**: Agent writes structured logs for each task (what it tried, what failed, why)
2. **Synthesis agents**: Periodically review multiple task logs to extract reusable patterns

The synthesis step identifies recurring themes across logs, surfacing insights that aren't obvious from any single execution. This approach is validated by academic research: Reflexion (NeurIPS 2023) achieved 91% pass@1 on HumanEval using episodic memory with self-reflection.

**Example diary entry format:**
```markdown
## Task: Add authentication to checkout flow
Attempted approaches:
1. JWT tokens in localStorage - failed due to XSS concerns
2. HTTP-only cookies - worked but needed CORS config

What worked: Redis session store with 24hr expiry
Mistakes made: Forgot to handle token refresh initially
Patterns discovered: Auth changes always need CORS update
```

## Evidence

- **Evidence Grade:** `validated-in-production`
- **Key Findings:**
  - Cat Wu (Anthropic): "Some people at Anthropic where for every task they do, they tell Claude Code to write a diary entry in a specific format... they even have these agents that look over the past memory and synthesize it into observations."
  - Reflexion (NeurIPS 2023): 91% pass@1 on HumanEval using episodic memory with self-reflection
  - Structured records (event, outcome, rationale) reduce repetition and improve synthesis (ParamMem 2026)

## How to use it

**Phase 1: Structured logging**
- Configure agents to write task diaries in consistent format
- Record what was attempted, what failed, what succeeded, and why

**Phase 2: Periodic synthesis**
- Run synthesis agents over recent logs (weekly, after N tasks)
- Identify patterns appearing in 3+ tasks
- Suggest general rules, slash commands, and test cases

**Phase 3: Knowledge integration**
- Feed synthesized insights into system prompts, reusable commands, automated checks, and test suites

## Trade-offs

**Pros:** Pattern detection across tasks, right abstraction level, automatic knowledge extraction, evolving system.
**Cons:** Storage overhead, synthesis complexity, false patterns, maintenance burden, privacy concerns.
