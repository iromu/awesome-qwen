## Problem

When AI agents attempt to simultaneously research, plan, and implement solutions, context contamination occurs. Competing priorities within a single conversation degrade output quality as the agent struggles to balance exploration, strategic thinking, and execution. This results in incomplete research, unclear plans, and suboptimal implementations.

## Solution

Break development workflows into isolated phases with clean handoffs between them. Each phase runs in a separate conversation with a fresh context window, focusing exclusively on its objective:

**Research Phase (Opus 4.1):**

- Deep exploration of requirements, existing code, and constraints
- Comprehensive background investigation
- No implementation concerns

**Planning Phase (Opus 4.1):**

- Create structured implementation roadmap
- Define clear steps and dependencies
- No coding distractions

**Implementation Phase (Sonnet 4.5):**

- Execute each plan step systematically
- Focus purely on code quality and functionality
- Leverage the distilled outputs from previous phases

**Key principle:** Pass only distilled conclusions between phases, not full conversation history. This prevents context pollution while maintaining necessary information flow.

## How to use it

**When to apply:**

- Complex features requiring significant background research
- Refactoring projects where understanding existing code is critical
- New codebases where architectural decisions need careful consideration
- Any task where mixing research and implementation degrades quality

**Implementation approach:**

1. **Research phase** - Start fresh conversation with a strong reasoning model
2. **Planning phase** - New conversation with distilled research findings
3. **Execution phase** - New conversation with the implementation plan

**Prerequisites:**

- Clear handoff documents between phases
- Discipline to resist combining phases
- Understanding of which model strengths to leverage

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**

- Higher quality outputs in each phase due to focused attention
- Prevents context contamination from competing objectives
- Deliberation before action improves tool use accuracy from 72% to 94% (Parisien et al. 2024)
- Leverages model-specific strengths (stronger models for reasoning, faster models for execution)
- Clearer mental model for complex projects

**Cons:**

- Requires more explicit phase management and handoffs
- Planning overhead adds ~35% latency
- Requires discipline to maintain phase boundaries
- Information loss risk if handoffs are poorly structured
- Higher total token usage across multiple conversations
