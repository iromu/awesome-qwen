## Problem

As AI models generate increasing amounts of code, the bottleneck shifts from code generation to code verification and review. Ensuring AI-generated code is syntactically correct, semantically correct, and aligns with intended functionality becomes crucial and time-consuming.

## Solution

Develop and employ AI-powered tools and processes for code review:
- AI agents that analyze code changes and highlight potential issues
- Tools that summarize intent or impact of code changes
- Interactive systems where reviewers can ask the AI to explain code
- Multi-agent approaches where one agent generates code while another critiques it
- Three-layer workflows: AI-only for style, AI-human for logic/security, human-only for architecture

## Evidence

- **Evidence Grade:** `emerging`
- **Key Findings:** GPT-4o achieved 68.50% classification accuracy in code review tasks; AI assistants have increased PR review time in heavily adopting teams due to volume of AI-generated changes

## How to use it

- Integrate AI verification tools into the PR review process
- Prompt agents to explain their generated code or provide rationales
- Focus human review on verifying alignment with high-level intent

## Trade-offs

* **Pros:** Reduces time on routine review, enables consistent enforcement of standards, can identify issues humans miss.
* **Cons:** Risk of hallucination, high false positive rates can lead to alert fatigue, increased PR review time in AI-heavy teams.
