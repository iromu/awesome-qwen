## Description: <br>
Build interactive web UIs with htmx — attribute-driven AJAX, CSS transitions, WebSockets, and SSE using HTML attributes, with no JavaScript framework or build step. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Third-Party Community Consideration
<span style="color:#d73a49">This skill is not owned or developed by NVIDIA. This skill has been developed and built to a third-party's requirements for this application and use case; see link to Non-NVIDIA [Iván Rodríguez Murillo Agent Card](https://github.com/iromu/awesome-qwen).</span> <!-- VERIFY: Frontmatter names a personal author (non-NVIDIA email) and the repo is a third-party awesome list; the card_link points at the source repository because no separate vendor card exists. --> <br>

## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers building server-rendered, hypermedia-driven web UIs with htmx 4.x, or migrating an existing htmx 2.x / React-Vue front-end to htmx 4 markup and APIs. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Validated against 5 internal eval cases in `evals/evals.json` (trigger checks plus per-case expected-output assertions), plus 9 automated schema/repository and semantic-version checks. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Correctness: Whether the generated htmx markup uses real v4 attributes, events and config keys rather than invented or 2.x-era syntax. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the skill triggers on htmx/hypermedia requests and does not fire on unrelated frontend work. <br>
- Reliability: Whether the skill reaches the expected result consistently across repeat runs. <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill completes the task without unnecessary steps or context overhead. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `expected_output`: Per-case assertion set checking the attributes, swap strategies and triggers the answer should contain. <br>
- `should_trigger`: Routing check that the skill activates for htmx work and stays silent for React/Vue or non-web requests. <br>
