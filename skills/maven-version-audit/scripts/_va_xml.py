"""hardened XML reading for the version-audit steps.

POMs and maven-metadata.xml files arrive from whichever repository mirror answers,
so they are parsed as untrusted input. defusedxml refuses DTDs, entity
declarations, and external entities outright, which closes both the
entity-expansion and the quadratic-expansion variants, and this module is the
single place that decision is made.

There is deliberately no stdlib fallback: a missing dependency fails loudly at
import rather than silently downgrading every step's parser. Declare it in
requirements.txt alongside the scripts that import this module.
